    "note": "Discharge Summary\n\nPatient: 49-year-old Hispanic woman\nAdmission Date: March 2020\nDischarge Date: Day 12\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the Modena University Hospital's emergency room for symptoms including chest pain, cough, and fever. Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV2. She was treated according to Regional Guidelines for COVID-19, with hydroxychloroquine, low-molecular-weight heparin, and antibiotic therapy. \n\nDuring the hospital stay, the patient developed symptoms of myocarditis, including chest pain, right bundle branch block, and moderate mitral insufficiency. Diagnostic imaging showed slight depression of the ejection fraction, increased myocardial T2 signal intensity, and pericardial effusion. \n\nTreatment was initiated with sotalol, acylsalicylic acid, and ramipril, which resulted in a reduction in symptoms and improvement of cardiac function. The patient was discharged on the 12th day of admission after improvement in symptoms and clearance of pericardial effusion. \n\nFollow-Up Instructions:\nThe patient should continue taking medications as prescribed and follow up with their primary care physician. The patient should maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid strenuous activities for the next few weeks. The patient should monitor symptoms and seek medical attention if there is any recurrence or worsening of symptoms. \n\nDischarge Condition:\nThe patient was discharged in a stable condition with improvement in symptoms and cardiac function.",

    "note": "Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient: 88-year-old female\n\nAdmission: Coronary Care Unit\n\nDiagnosis: Atrioventricular Block, Third Degree\n\nHistory: Admission was two weeks after the patient experienced dizziness and shortness of breath. The extended history revealed she had three episodes of falling and syncope in the months prior to admission, but the cause of these episodes had not yet been investigated. Electrocardiography (ECG) at admission revealed third-degree atrioventricular block with an abnormally low heart rate.\n\nTreatment: The patient was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease with paranoid symptoms 24 months prior to admission and started medication for it. She was also being treated for hypertension with medications. It was concluded that the atrioventricular block was caused by her medication for Alzheimer's Disease and this was discontinued. She was then given temporary pacemaker treatment, followed by a permanent pacemaker.\n\nObservations: The patient had no history of ischemic heart disease and no chest pain. The physical examination at admission and discharge revealed no positive neurological deficits other than her known cognitive dysfunction. The patient experienced slightly elevated cardiac biomarkers but echocardiography was found to be normal. The patient had slight electrolyte imbalances in sodium and calcium levels but normal red and white blood counts.\n\nDischarge Plan: The patient was discharged to her own home with a permanent pacemaker. After being discharged, the patient decided not to reinitiate the medication for Alzheimer's Disease.",

    "note": "Hospital Course: Patient presented to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident with loss of consciousness and persistent bradycardia. He had facial abrasions and epistaxis, but no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or rhinorrhea, or extremity deformity. He was found to have bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity followed by timely resuscitation. Glasgow Coma Scale score was E1VTM1 and bilateral pupil size was 3.5 mm without light reflex. ECG findings revealed ST-segment elevation in leads II and V3-6, suspected acute myocardial infarction, and subsequent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and ST-segment depression. Bedside cardiac ultrasound showed grossly normal wall motion of the left ventricle while diagnostic coronary angiography revealed coronary artery spasm and a myocardial bridge of the left anterior descending artery, with no occluded segments or flow-limiting lesions.\n \nManagement and Treatment: Patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to poor response to inotropic agents and suspected liver laceration with hemoperitoneum. The administration of an intracoronary nitroglycerin injection led to significant increase in the native left coronary artery and right coronary artery diameters. Left ventriculogram showed mild mitral valve regurgitation and mild hypokinesia of the inferior wall. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 60% under ECMO and inotropic agents; however, patient remained with a low cardiac output and eventually progressed into shock and died.\n\nPatient Condition and Prognosis: Despite adequate resuscitation, the patient's condition continued to progressively deteriorate, leading to his eventual death.",
